# üìã Dell catalog excel data transfer

This Python application provides a graphical interface to **copy filtered rows from a source Excel file to a destination Excel file**, based on **product categories** and other conditions.

It uses `tkinter` for the user interface and `openpyxl` to manipulate Excel files. The allowed product categories are configured via a `.env` file, making it possible to add or remove categories.

## ‚úÖ Features

- GUI to select both source and destination Excel files.
- Only copies rows where:
  - The **category (Column A)** is in the allowed list (from `.env`).
  - The **price (Column L)** is **not 0 or empty**.
  - The **Part Number (Column C)** does **not already exist** in the destination file.
- For each valid row:
  - Copies `Part Number` to **Columns C and D** in the destination.
  - Copies `Column S` of source to **Column E** in the destination.
  - Copies `Price (Column L)` to **Column H** in the destination.
- Skips rows with missing/duplicate part numbers or disallowed categories.
- Keeps a live **log** of actions in a GUI text box.
- Uses `.env` file to define allowed product categories.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. Run the script:
```
python dell_catalog.py
```

2. A GUI will appear:

- Click "Seleccionar archivo fuente" to choose the Excel file you want to read data from.

- Click "Seleccionar archivo destino" to choose where the filtered data will be copied.

- Click "Copiar Datos" to perform the copy operation.

3. Logs will appear in the text area showing the results of the copy process.

## üìå Important Notes
- Both Excel files must be .xlsx format.

- The app reads from the first sheet (active) in both files.

- Assumes headers are on row 1, so copying starts at row 2.

- Make sure the destination Excel file is closed before running this app to avoid save errors.
